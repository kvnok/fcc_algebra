Let's break down Calvin's financial transactions step by step:

1. **Starting Balance:** $1,598.47
2. **Direct Deposit:** +$517.62 (to be received at 5 pm)
3. **House Payment:** -$494.90 (automatic deduction)
4. **Online Payments (next morning):**
   - Payment 1: -$506.70
   - Payment 2: -$264.07
5. **Minimum Desired Balance:** $1,500.00 (to avoid a low balance penalty)

Now, let's calculate how much money Calvin needs to transfer to his account to ensure he maintains a balance of at least $1,500.00:

\[
\text{Balance After Direct Deposit} = \text{Starting Balance} + \text{Direct Deposit}
\]

\[
\text{Balance After House Payment} = \text{Balance After Direct Deposit} - \text{House Payment}
\]

\[
\text{Balance After Online Payments} = \text{Balance After House Payment} - \text{Payment 1} - \text{Payment 2}
\]

Calvin needs to transfer an amount to reach or exceed the Minimum Desired Balance. Let's calculate this:

\[
\text{Transfer Amount} = \text{Balance After Online Payments} - \text{Minimum Desired Balance}
\]

Here's the Python code to calculate this:
'''
# Given values
starting_balance = 1598.47
direct_deposit = 517.62
house_payment = 494.90
online_payment_1 = 506.70
online_payment_2 = 264.07
min_desired_balance = 1500.00

# Calculate balances
balance_after_direct_deposit = starting_balance + direct_deposit
balance_after_house_payment = balance_after_direct_deposit - house_payment
balance_after_online_payments = balance_after_house_payment - online_payment_1 - online_payment_2

# Calculate transfer amount
transfer_amount = max(0, min_desired_balance - balance_after_online_payments)

# Output rounded to the nearest cent
print("Calvin needs to transfer:", round(transfer_amount, 2))

'''
This code calculates the amount Calvin needs to transfer to avoid a low balance penalty and ensures the answer is rounded to the nearest cent.
